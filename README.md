# CookShare
A website that allows users to login and share recipes with other users. Users will be able to create recipes, view all the recipes, or filter by types of cuisine. Users will also be able to click on an author of a recipe and see all the recipes they have shared. Only the creator of the recipe is allowed to edit/delete the recipe.
